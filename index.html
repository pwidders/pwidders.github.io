            Hello! Throughout my life, I've been a student, a military soldier and a salesman with a family background 
            that instilled the virtues of a hard work-ethic, kindness, honor and respect for people of all backgrounds. 
            Most of my professional career was based in sales and customer-service, however I've recently found a love 
            for web development and I'm working diligently to complete a full-stack coding bootcamp at the UC Berkeley Extension and 
            pursue a career in this field! I love building things and problem-solving. I also hold a bachelor's degree in 
            communications from California State University East Bay. Aside from my professional activities, I'm proud to say I'm recently engaged to 
            my beautiful fiance Hannah and we have a Boston Terrier/French Bulldog mix dog named Rico. They are both awesome 
            and occupy what little free time I have these days. 
            </p>

            <p> 
            In the Army, I was a 13M field-artilleryman. I had a chance to see more of the world making stops in Ft. Sill, OK, South Korea
            and Iraq. I also performed the gun salute for many military funerals throughout the mid-South. I really enjoyed my
            time in the service in which I learned many life lessons in leadership and grew so much. While attending college,
            I worked in sales and customer-service for an industrial supply company named Grainger, and then for another called Fastenal. My latest
            role was doing account manager for a staffing firm named Kforce, which is where I was really introduced to tech.
            </p>
            
            <p>I grew up here in the Bay Area and I love it for it's amazing weather, beautiful beaches and access to wonderful 
            outdoor activities like snowboarding and hiking. Sports have also always been near to my heart. I'd very much like
            to see the Oakland A's win another championship in my lifetime. Some of my favorite places include Hawaii (Maui), Lake Tahoe,
            Lake Shasta and tailgating at the Oakland Coliseum. Music is also near and dear to my heart and I listen to a wide variety
            of music from Motown to Deftones. Also, I haven't quite let go of my childhood dreams of being a rockstar
             singer/guitar player. One can still hope!
